## Why did you select the doctype you used?
I used HTML5 because of the new semantic elements like section and article

## How does your doctype compare to other commonly seen (strict) doctypes?
HTML5 is more strict, since semantic elements clearly define content

## How is the markup for your document semantically correct? Are there any non-semantic elements that you needed for styling purposes? If you used divs and /or spans, be sure to account for them in your explanation.
I used div and span to stylize specific regions within section and article tags. 

## In your own words, how is the hCard information you added useful to both humans and automated user agents trying to access your content?
If my resume is being parsed by a program, it will be able to understand what content is within those tags.

## Explain how your markup and stylesheet leverages the principles of progressive enhancement
I used CSS libraries like webkit to leverage image styling. I also used a modern font face to give the resume a cleaner finish.
