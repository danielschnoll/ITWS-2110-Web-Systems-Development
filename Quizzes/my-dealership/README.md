# Quiz 1

### Contents
- JSON file in /data
- CSS in /css
- Images referenced externally (nothing in /img)
- jQuery in /js

### Choices
\<p> and \<div> tags are the easiest to work with, and since the content was being loaded dynamically, it was important to make sure it was easy to manipulate

### Issues
The one issue I still have with the site is that I can't load CSS from the css file. All styling must be applied via jQuery, which limited my ability to style the site.
